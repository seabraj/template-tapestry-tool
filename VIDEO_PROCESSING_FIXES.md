# Video Processing Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified from Error Logs

Based on the browser console and Supabase Edge Function logs, the following critical issues were identified:

### 1. **Missing `file_url` in Edge Function Requests**
- **Problem**: The request body sent to the Cloudinary concatenation function was missing the `file_url` field
- **Impact**: Backend couldn't process videos without direct file URLs
- **Fix**: Updated VideoProcessor to include `file_url` in all video objects sent to the edge function

### 2. **Edge Function 500 Errors**
- **Problem**: The Cloudinary concatenation function was failing with non-2xx status codes
- **Impact**: Video processing pipeline completely failed
- **Fix**: Added better error handling, validation, and retry logic

### 3. **Video File Corruption**
- **Problem**: Videos were becoming corrupted during processing
- **Impact**: Final video output was unusable
- **Fix**: Enhanced asset availability checks and processing validation

### 4. **Asset Availability Issues**
- **Problem**: Temporary assets were not becoming available in time for processing
- **Impact**: Processing would fail when trying to access temporary files
- **Fix**: Increased wait times and improved availability checks

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced VideoProcessor (src/services/videoProcessor.ts)**

#### Added Retry Logic
```typescript
// Retry logic with exponential backoff
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
  try {
    // Process video
    break; // Success
  } catch (error) {
    if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
    // Wait before retry: 2s, 4s, 8s
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000));
  }
}
```

#### Enhanced Validation
```typescript
// Comprehensive sequence validation
private validateSequences(sequences: any[]) {
  const validSequences = [];
  const errors = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < sequences.length; i++) {
    const seq = sequences[i];
    
    // Check file_url
    if (!seq.file_url) {
      errors.push(`Sequence ${i + 1}: Missing file_url`);
      continue;
    }
    
    // Check duration
    if (!seq.duration || seq.duration <= 0) {
      errors.push(`Sequence ${i + 1}: Invalid duration`);
      continue;
    }
    
    // Validate URL format
    try {
      new URL(seq.file_url);
    } catch (e) {
      errors.push(`Sequence ${i + 1}: Invalid URL format`);
      continue;
    }
    
    validSequences.push(seq);
  }
  
  if (errors.length > 0 && validSequences.length === 0) {
    throw new Error(`All sequences failed validation:\n${errors.join('\n')}`);
  }
  
  return validSequences;
}
```

#### Better Error Messages
- Added detailed error logging with sequence names and specific failure reasons
- Improved progress tracking with phase descriptions
- Enhanced debugging information

### 2. **Updated Edge Function (supabase/functions/cloudinary-concatenate/index.ts)**

#### Improved Asset Availability Checks
```typescript
async function waitForAssetAvailability(
  publicId: string, 
  resourceType: string = 'video', 
  maxAttempts: number = 20, // Increased from 10
  progressTracker?: ProgressTracker
): Promise<boolean> {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    try {
      const resource = await cloudinary.api.resource(publicId, { resource_type: resourceType });
      
      // Additional checks for video resources
      if (resourceType === 'video' && resource.status !== 'complete') {
        throw new Error(`Asset not ready, status: ${resource.status}`);
      }
      
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxAttempts) {
        throw new Error(`Asset ${publicId} never became available after ${maxAttempts} attempts`);
      }
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000)); // Increased delay
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

#### Enhanced Request Validation
```typescript
// Validate video objects have required fields
for (let i = 0; i < videos.length; i++) {
  const video = videos[i];
  if (!video.publicId && !video.file_url) {
    throw new Error(`Video ${i + 1}: Missing both publicId and file_url`);
  }
  if (!video.duration || video.duration <= 0) {
    throw new Error(`Video ${i + 1}: Invalid duration: ${video.duration}`);
  }
  if (!video.file_url) {
    throw new Error(`Video ${i + 1}: Missing file_url for processing`);
  }
}
```

#### Better Error Handling
- Added comprehensive logging with timestamps
- Improved error messages with specific failure reasons
- Enhanced cleanup procedures for temporary assets

### 3. **Updated ExportPanel (src/components/ExportPanel.tsx)**

#### Pre-Processing Validation
```typescript
// Validate all sequences have file URLs
const invalidSequences = selectedSequences.filter(seq => !seq.file_url);
if (invalidSequences.length > 0) {
  toast({
    title: "Invalid Video Sequences",
    description: "Some selected sequences are missing video files. Please refresh the video library.",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  return;
}
```

#### Enhanced Error Display
- Added detailed error messages with debugging instructions
- Improved progress tracking with phase descriptions
- Better user feedback for different error scenarios

## Testing and Deployment

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Upload Test Videos**: Use the admin panel to upload test videos for each platform
2. **Sequence Selection**: Test selecting multiple video sequences
3. **Duration Configuration**: Test both trimming and non-trimming scenarios  
4. **Platform Switching**: Test processing for YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram formats
5. **Error Scenarios**: Test with invalid sequences, missing files, and network issues

### Error Monitoring
- Check browser console for detailed logs during processing
- Monitor Supabase Edge Function logs for backend errors
- Watch for Cloudinary API errors and rate limits

### Performance Optimizations
- Retry logic prevents temporary failures from breaking the entire process
- Enhanced validation catches issues early before expensive processing
- Better asset availability checks prevent premature processing attempts

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
The following environment variables need to be configured in your Supabase project:

```bash
# In Supabase Edge Functions environment
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
ENVIRONMENT=development  # or production
```

### Cloudinary Configuration
Ensure your Cloudinary account has:
- Video processing capabilities enabled
- Sufficient storage and bandwidth quota
- Proper CORS settings for your domain

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Video file corrupt" errors
**Solution**: This is often caused by attempting to process assets before they're fully available. The enhanced availability checks should resolve this.

### Issue: Edge function timeout
**Solution**: Retry logic with exponential backoff helps handle temporary timeouts. Consider increasing function timeout limits if processing large videos.

### Issue: "Missing file_url" errors
**Solution**: Ensure all video assets in the database have valid `file_url` fields populated. Use the admin panel to re-upload corrupted entries.

### Issue: Cloudinary rate limits
**Solution**: Implement request queuing and consider upgrading your Cloudinary plan for higher limits.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Edge Function**: Use `supabase functions deploy cloudinary-concatenate` to deploy the updated function
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Run through the complete video processing workflow
3. **Monitor Logs**: Watch both client and server logs for any remaining issues
4. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust timeout values and retry counts based on your specific use case

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# View Edge Function logs
supabase functions logs cloudinary-concatenate

# Test Edge Function locally
supabase functions serve cloudinary-concatenate

# Deploy Edge Function
supabase functions deploy cloudinary-concatenate
```

The fixes implemented should resolve the major video processing issues you were experiencing. The enhanced error handling, validation, and retry logic make the system much more robust and user-friendly.
